Just had a bit of fun making a WUPHF site, as whoever owns WUPHF.com never did anything with it. So I got [WUPHF.co.uk](https://wuphf.co.uk) and made a fan site.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/wuphf/wuphf.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Link to [WUPHF.co.uk](https://wuphf.co.uk)
</div>
