For daily driving and for my wifes business, [PlutosPantry](/projects/Plutos_Pantry), we have a 2006 Mercedes-Benz E-Class E220 CDI. It has what is apparently a fairly common issue with the automatic shifter. On occasion when you start the car to the left of the mileage you should see P/R/N/D and to the right C/S. The fault will start by not displaying anything where P/R/N/D should be, and apparently can also not show C/S but mine hasn't done this. When this is missing you can shift to D but it will be quite clunky, and drive but the car will stuck in first gear, and you won't be able to select reverse or park without turning the car off first.

This is caused by faulty optical switches in the mechanism. You can replace them with [TCPT1300](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/slotted-optical-switches/7103816?gb=s) or [TCPT1350](https://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/slotted-optical-switches/8187512?gb=s), TCPT1300 is a like for like sensor but 1350 also work.

You can either just replace the shifter with a used one on eBay which at the time of writing range from about £80-£150 but as these are used the fault could just occur again, tomorrow, next week, etc. so really the best option is repairing your one.

I'll be offering this as a service for £90 including the return postage to you, just get it to me and I will fix it for you. If you're interested then leave a comment or email me at [info@professorshroom.com](mailto:info@professorshroom.com).

If you'd like to try this yourself I will try to explain below the process, but it does require quite advanced soldering knowledge and ability.

First you have to remove the shifter itself from the car, there's plenty of videos on YouTube showing you how to do this, [like this one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiquZMIj74s).

Once the shifter is out the actual repair can begin.
