In 2017 I bought a Renault Megane RS 225 (named Homer for his number plate) and loved it, but it only lasted 6 months before the engine failed, I think due to poor matienece across its life. [I do at least have this cool cinematic of it, as it was used in a film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjZ18XtUKZc).

Despite this I decided to buy a 2010 Renault Megane RS 250, as after watching reviews this was pretty much the best hot hatch of all time, and I liked the looks of it.

When I bought the car it was pretty much standard aside from a remap which took it to about 300BHP, not bad, but now it's running 400BHP. Below is the build sheet which includes all of the mods I've done to it so far.

Some of the mods I've done include the turbo 400 kit from [K-Tec Racing](https://k-tecracing.com/) which consists of a Garrett GTX2867R Gen 2 Turbo, 630cc injectors, de-cat (plus a sports cat lower in the system due to heat) and more supporting mods. Previously I've already added a Wagner intercooler, K-Tec induction kit, oil catch can which required a battery relocation and a custom mount for the ECU.

Some of the cosmetic mods I've done are a complete custom interior done by [KolourKoncept](https://www.kolourkoncept.co.uk/), lightweight Hyundai i30N alloys. Lots of carbon fibre trim bits on both the exterior and interior of the car made by [Carbon Skins](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100057058466032).

I've also retrofitted a R-Link system from the facelift model which required some coding and a custom loom as this option was never offered on the pre-facelift. This gives me Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, the RS monitor (which shows temps, boost, 0-60 times, lap times, service info, BHP etc.). All of the features are working including the reverse camera, parking sensors and apps from the now defunk app store.

All of this I think makes this on of if not the nicest Renault Megane RS in the country.
