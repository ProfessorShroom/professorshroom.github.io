I recently acquired a free 2014 iMac with a faulty motherboard, but the screen worked fine. I've seen a few people convert them into what is basically just a Apple Studio Display. These screens are 60Hz 5120x2880, and look amazing so for a second monitor/graphics monitor it's perfect.

You basically have to remove everything from the iMac housing, motherboard, power supply, hard drive, and replace it with a display driver board, speaker crossboard (if you want speakers), fan controller (if you want a fan), and 12v or 24v power supply.

There's a few repos I found with different ways to mount all of this hardware, but none that I found were complete, and some were just wrong.

So I decided to use the good models I found with slight modifications, mostly just to reduce the excessive amount of filament they were using and just fix the broken models. I did this to try and make the most complete set of parts required to convert one of these monitors.

The electronics needed for this conversion are as below -

I did do some modications to my parts, I cut the power button off of the supplied board as I just wired in the original iMac power button to serve that function, this allowed me to print my RAM cover which built in buttons and DisplayPort/USB C ports for a much cleaner look. I wired in the original iMac power plug to power the Meanwell power supply.

Here's the repo below.
